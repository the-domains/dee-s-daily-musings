description: "By Rob Copsey (@robcopsey) Congratulations to Zayn, who lands straight in at Number 1 on this week's Official Albums Chart with his solo debut. Mind Of Mine takes the top spot on this week's chart, finishing just over 4,000 combined sales ahead of his closest rival, Adele's 25, which is knocked down to second place."
